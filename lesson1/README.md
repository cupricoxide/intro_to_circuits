# intro to circuits lesson 1
what is all this electricity business about?

## lesson materials
the presentation used for this class is available in [PDF form](lesson1.pdf) as well as [Google Drive form](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15GSJ7vIjcBHzid15Rd07gUInJye-16uV2sa6j8g2wJ4/edit?usp=sharing)

Circuits referenced in that presentation are available in this directory. Each circuit has three files:

* circuit_1-N_schem.png - the circuit schematic
    * you should try to build your breadboard circuit from this schematic
* circuit_1-N_bb.png - an example breadboard layout for the circuit
    * use this is you are having trouble translating schematic to breadboard
    * there is no one right answer; your solution could and probably will look completely different that this
* circuit_1-N.fzz - [fritzing](http://fritzing.org/) file for the circuit
    * this is what the schematic and breadboard files are generated from
    * you can play around with circuit changes here in both schematic and breadboard mode
