# introduction to circuits
Electrons and whatnot

## how to use this repository

* General tool setup and use lives in `gettingstarted`
* Circuits and presentations from each lesson live in `lesson1,2,etc`

### lesson recaps on google drive
1. [lesson 1 recap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15GSJ7vIjcBHzid15Rd07gUInJye-16uV2sa6j8g2wJ4/edit?usp=sharing)
2. [lesson 2 recap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ate2u_c8EQQxeNAypdq-suxV5XIjno04xnrJX5S_RK0/edit?usp=sharing)

### saving this stuff to your computer
You can keep all this on your computer in one of several ways:

* [Download the entire repository as a zip file](https://github.com/wileycousins-edu/intro_to_circuits/archive/master.zip)
    * You'll have to do this every time the repository gets updated
* Use git
    * With git, you can pull in new changes without having to re-download everything
    * What is git? Git is what makes GitHub great. [Learn how to set it up here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

## recommended software

You should download [fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) to view and edit the raw circuit files from which the images are exported.

You should also take a look at [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/), an online circuit editor and simulator.

## recommended reading
This list will grow as the class progresses. My apologies if it is only Wikipedia links right now.

## thanks
Thanks to Mike Mitterer, whose [Fritzing multimeter](https://github.com/MikeMitterer/fritzing-multimeter) is used in the fritzing circuits for this class.
