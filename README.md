# introduction to circuits
Electrons and whatnot

## how to use this repository

* General tool setup and use lives in `gettingstarted`
* Circuits and presentations from each lesson live in `lesson1,2,etc`

### lesson recaps on google drive
1. [lesson 1 recap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15GSJ7vIjcBHzid15Rd07gUInJye-16uV2sa6j8g2wJ4/edit?usp=sharing)
2. [lesson 2 recap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ate2u_c8EQQxeNAypdq-suxV5XIjno04xnrJX5S_RK0/edit?usp=sharing)

### saving this stuff to your computer
You can keep all this on your computer in one of several ways:

* [Download the entire repository as a zip file](https://github.com/wileycousins-edu/intro_to_circuits/archive/master.zip)
    * You'll have to do this every time the repository gets updated
* Use git (recommended)
    * With git, you can pull in new changes without having to re-download everything
    * What is git? Git is what makes GitHub great. [Learn how to set it up here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

### feedback
While using this repository, if you find something confusing, contridictory, incorrect, or otherwise questionable, click on that button to the right labeled "Issues" and open up an issue. Your feedback is helpful and much appreciated, and if it's all collected here, it's a nice to-do list for me to fix things.

## recommended software

You should download [fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) to view and edit the raw circuit files from which the images are exported.

You should also take a look at [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/), an online circuit editor and simulator.

And, as mentioned earlier, you should download git (if you know how to use the command line), [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/) (if you use a Mac), or [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) (if you use Windows) so you can keep the class material up to date on your computer with very little effort.

## recommended reading
This list will grow as the class progresses. My apologies if it is only Wikipedia links right now.

## thanks
Thanks to Mike Mitterer, whose [Fritzing multimeter](https://github.com/MikeMitterer/fritzing-multimeter) is used in the fritzing circuits for this class.
