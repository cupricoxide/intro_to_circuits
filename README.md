# introduction to circuits
Electrons and whatnot

## how to use this repository

* General tool setup and use lives in `gettingstarted`
* Circuits and presentations from each lesson live in `lesson1,2,etc`

## recommended software

You should download [fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) to view and edit the raw circuit files from which the images are exported.

You should also take a look at [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/), an online circuit editor and simulator.

## recommended reading
This list will grow as the class progresses. My apologies if it is only Wikipedia links right now.
